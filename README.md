# nkframework
This a small PHP FrameWork which will let you build your small web apps quickly.

It's have been a while when i first knew about frameworks, and instead of using one, i've decided to start my little pretty own framework.
I called it NkFramework.

I've started by building a service that helps handling all interactions with the DB (Mysql using PDO) and it was fun.
This framework has many other features:
- Data Management (A pretty easy to use feature that makes all the sorting, filtring, counting & others similar things).
- Configuration (An easy way to configure your web app).
- DbAccessor (DB interactions management).
- Genarator (Any random strings ?)
- HttpRequest (started using annotations to handle request)
- PageManager (We are already organizing our view part, part we badly need a template engine intergartion to use the MVC).
- Session (Wanna store some data in sessions ?)
- Loader (Forget about including files, i'll do it all)
